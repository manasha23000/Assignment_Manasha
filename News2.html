    <h3>Oppenheimer leads the nominations at the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) Awards, days after it triumphed at the Golden Globes.</h3>

    <p>Christopher Nolan's film has four nominations, while American Fiction, Barbie and Killers of the Flower Moon each have three.</p>
    <p>However, Leonardo DiCaprio is notably absent from the best actor category.</p>
    <p>The winners are voted for by Sag-Aftra's membership of more than 119,000 actors.</p>
    <p>Succession, Beef, The Crown, Ted Lasso and The Bear are among the nominees in the television categories.</p>

<h1> The film nominees</h1>

<ul>
    <li>4 nominations - Oppenheimer</li>
    <li>3 - American Fiction, Killers of the Flower Moon, Barbie</li>
    <li>2 - The Holdovers, Maestro, Nyad, Poor Things, The Color Purple</li>
    <li>1 - Rustin, Ferrari</li>
</ul>


<p>While DiCaprio is a notable omission in best actor, this is a particularly crowded year for the category, and five other favourites have been nominated at the SAG Awards.</p>
<p>Bradley Cooper, Colman Domingo, Paul Giamatti, Cillian Murphy and Jeffrey Wright are all recognised.</p>
<p>In the best actress race, the four women deemed to be favourites for an Oscar nomination - Sandra Huller, Emma Stone, Lily Gladstone and Carey Mulligan - are joined at SAG by Margot Robbie for Barbie.</p>
<p>The SAG Awards offer a good indication of which actors could be nominated later this month for the Oscars. This year's Academy Awards take place on 10 March.</p>
<p>Oppenheimer and Succession <b><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-67908835" class="link3">were the big winners at Sunday's Golden Globes </a></b>while Anatomy of a Fall, The Holdovers, Barbie and Poor Things won two prizes each.</p>
