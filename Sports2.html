       <b> Nottingham Forest's Harry Toffolo says he feared his career had been ended by his history of betting and that it "inspired" him to help others with gambling and mental health problems.</b></p>

    <p>The 28-year-old defender was given <b><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/66825929" class="custom-link">a suspended five-month ban </a></b>in September for 375 breaches of betting rules.</p>
    <p>The independent commission that heard the case found bets were made when his "mental health was at a very low ebb".</p>
    <p>"I felt like I lost everything", said Toffolo when reflecting on the charges.</p>
    <p>"It was 100% the most difficult part of not just my career, but of my life.</p>
    <p>"It scares me because I was in the last year of my contract and I thought the dream I worked so hard to get was over.</p>
    <p>"I was thinking my career is going to be over because of what happened six to nine years ago, which came back to sting me."</p>

    <p>Toffolo said the decision of the Football Association's independent regulatory commission to hand him a fine of almost Â£21,000 and a suspended ban was "the light at the end of the tunnel" after five months of uncertainty.</p>
    <p> "When I got that email sent through from the FA [outlining breaches], I dropped on the floor and had a full-on panic attack," Toffolo told <b><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p0h44np8" class="custom-link">BBC Radio Nottingham.</a></b></p>

    <p>"I recognised the user names, but I didn't recognise those bets. I can't remember placing them, but they are me. I don't identify myself with the person on that Excel spreadsheet.</p>
    <p>"I was mortified and ashamed of them.</p>
    <p>"My kids will never forget the day they saw their daddy cry."</p>
<p>It was last April that the former Millwall, Lincoln and Huddersfield full-back first learned of the investigation into his betting breaches, which related to his time at Norwich City and took in loan spells at Swindon, Rotherham, Peterborough and Scunthorpe between 2014 and 2017.</p>
<p>Toffolo placed 15 bets against his own team at the time, the majority of which were accumulators. He also placed two 25p bets on himself to score in the League One play-off final in 2015, which his Swindon team lost 4-0 against Preston.</p>
